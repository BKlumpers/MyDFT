/*****************************************************************

Basic closed-shell spin-restricted DFT-solver for simple molecules using STO-NG

Author: B. Klumpers (bartkl@live.nl)

Published under GNU General Public License 3.0

Allows for SCF-computation of molecular energies for simple molecules.
Testcases for H, He, H2, HeH+ and He2 are included.

*currently the SCF employs the HF-scheme until numerical quadrature is added
